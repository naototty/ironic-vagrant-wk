Ironic (mitaka-eol branch)
======

Ironic is an integrated OpenStack project which aims to provision bare
metal machines instead of virtual machines, forked from the Nova Baremetal
driver. It is best thought of as a bare metal hypervisor **API** and a set
of plugins which interact with the bare metal hypervisors. By default, it
will use PXE and IPMI together to provision and turn on/off machines,
but Ironic also supports vendor-specific plugins which may implement
additional functionality.
